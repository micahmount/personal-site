    description: I've had the privilege of working with UNICEF Kid Power for several years. During that time, I've transitioned to web development, and begun to do more and more work on their marketing site. One day recently I "looked up" and realized that I'd built every public page on the site!

    description: I lead the technical support team for years at Active For Good; after moving on to web development perhaps it was only natural to take on this project. I completely rebuilt the admin dashboard--the tool used to create, manage and empower customers to facilitate Active For Good Activity Challenges.

    description: This site! This has been my 1st experience using a static site generator; and it's been fun! I started out with the [sustain](https://www.github.com/nurlansu/hugo-sustain/) theme and then customized it considerably in order to get the styling and features I wanted. My personal favorite addition, was actually one of the easiest; adding categories, tags and reading time to my blog posts as well as the ability to view the blog using those options as filters. It was a super easy addition, but brings a lot of value for users.

    description: Developed this custom WordPress site for a successful Herbalist and Health Coach as an integral part of her overall growth strategy. Key needs were a centralized CRM integrated with a full featured CMS. Phase one of this project was the customer facing marketing site. I helped the customer pick a design that fit her needs and had good accessibility with responsive design and UX. Then, once the marketing site was launched, phase two was that we completely overhauled her learning platform and integrated it with the marketing site. Not only was she able to save significantly on recurring expenses, but we were also able to improve her customer journey by giving them the convenience of one integrated experience from the beginning of the sales cycle to the learning platform and even health coaching interactions. Within six months her sales quadrupled and her customer base increased 10x.
