    description: Developed this custom WordPress site for a successful Herbalist and Health Coach as an integral part of her overall growth strategy. Key needs were a centralized CRM integrated with a full featured CMS. Phase one of this project was the customer facing marketing site. I helped the customer pick a design that fit her needs and had good accessibility with responsive design and UX. Then, once the marketing site was launched, phase two was that we completely overhauled her learning platform and integrated it with the marketing site. Not only was she able to save significantly on recurring expenses, but we were also able to improve her customer journey by giving them the convenience of one integrated experience from the beginning of the sales cycle to the learning platform and even health coaching interactions. Within six months her sales quadrupled and her customer base increased 10x.
